\title{Create a ggplot2 theme consistent with the Grattan style guide.}
\usage{
theme_grattan(
  base_size = 18,
  base_family = "sans",
  chart_type = "normal",
  flipped = FALSE,
  background = "white",
  legend = "none",
  panel_borders = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{base_size}{Size for text elements. Defaults to 18, as per the Grattan
style guide.}

\item{base_family}{Font family for text elements. Defaults to "sans",
indistinguishable from Arial.}

\item{chart_type}{"normal" by detault. Set to "scatter" for scatter plots.}

\item{flipped}{FALSE by default. Set to TRUE if using coord_flip(). If set to
TRUE, the theme will show a vertical axis line, ticks & panel grid, while
hiding the horizontals. Ignored for type = "scatter".}

\item{background}{"white" by default. Set to "orange" or "box" if you're
making a chart to go in a Grattan report box.}

\item{legend}{"off" by default. Set to "bottom", "left", "right" or "top" as
desired, or a two element numeric vector such as c(0.9, 0.1).}

\item{panel_borders}{`FALSE` by default. Set to `TRUE` to enable a black
border around the plotting area.}

\examples{

# This function goes most of the way to making your charts Grattan-y,
# but manual tweaking will almost definitely be required

# A minimal example:
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) +
    geom_point() +
    theme_grattan()

# To ensure your x-axis is at zero (or some other value you choose),
# you may need to manually tweak the scale of the y-axis.
# Use scale_y_continuous_grattan() for some sensible default values, which
# may need further tweaking.

ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) +
    geom_point() +
    scale_y_continuous_grattan() +
    theme_grattan()

# You'll notice in the example above that the top of the chart now looks
# good; the bottom has two
# points that are half hanging off the axis. Try the following, substituing
# any value (incl. 0) for 10 as you like:

ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) +
    geom_point() +
    scale_y_continuous_grattan(limits = c(10, NA)) +
    theme_grattan()

# An example with colours follows. See ?grattan_pal for more information and
# options.

ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg, col = factor(cyl))) +
    geom_point() +
    scale_y_continuous_grattan(limits = c(10, NA)) +
    scale_colour_manual(values = grattan_pal(n = 3)) +
    theme_grattan()

# The legend is off by default. You may wish to turn it on. Here's how:

ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg, col = factor(cyl))) +
    geom_point() +
    scale_y_continuous_grattan(limits = c(10, NA)) +
    scale_colour_manual(values = grattan_pal(n = 3)) +
    theme_grattan(legend = "bottom")

# The flipped = TRUE option makes things easier when using coord_flip, as in:

ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg, col = factor(cyl))) +
    geom_point() +
    scale_y_continuous_grattan(limits = c(10, NA)) +
    scale_colour_manual(values = grattan_pal(n = 3)) +
    theme_grattan(flipped = TRUE, legend = "bottom") +
    coord_flip()


# Making a chart to go in a box? Then you'll want the background = "orange"
# option, as in:

ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg, col = factor(cyl))) +
    geom_point() +
    scale_y_continuous_grattan(limits = c(10, NA)) +
    scale_colour_manual(values = grattan_pal(n = 3)) +
    theme_grattan(flipped = TRUE, background = "orange") +
    theme(legend.position = "bottom") +
    coord_flip()


# Want to make a 'self-contained' chart that includes a title/subtitle/caption,
# eg. to go on the Grattan Blog? If so, just add them - they'll be properly
# left-aligned when you save them with grattan_save(), like this:

 ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg, col = factor(cyl))) +
    geom_point() +
    scale_y_continuous_grattan(limits = c(10, NA)) +
    scale_colour_manual(values = grattan_pal(n = 3)) +
    theme_grattan() +
    labs(title = "Title goes here",
         subtitle = "Subtitle goes here",
         caption = "Notes: Notes go here\nSource: Source goes here")

 # The plot above won't look right in RStudio's viewer - the text is
 # aligned to the left of the plot area, not the image. Once you save it,
 # the file should have properly-aligned text:

 \dontrun{grattan_save("your_file.png")}
